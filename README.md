The individual classifiers (results section 3.1-3-3) can be replicated with the following scripts: classification_1* - classification_3*.m.
The multimodal classifiers (restults section 3.4-3.6) can be replicated with the following scripts: classification_4* - classification_7*.m.

To do this, you must first save all classifiers which you can find in "Classifier_Manuscript" and specify this path in the respective script (marked in the code with add*).

To reproduce the figures displayed in the manuscript, use the respective code, which is labeled Figure 2 - 4 and Figure S1 - S2.
